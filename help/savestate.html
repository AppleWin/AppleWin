		<p style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Overview:
		</p>
		<p>The complete<sub style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">1</sub> Apple //e state can be saved 
			to a PC file at any time. This can be useful for continuity across AppleWin 
			sessions or to help with games that don't have a save option.</p>
		<p>The state can optionally be automatically saved on AppleWin exit, and (automatically) restored on AppleWin restart.</p>
		<p>This is all controlled by the AppleWin <a href="cfg-advanced.html">Configuration</a> tab labeled <em>Advanced</em>.</p>
		<p style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Details:</p>
		<p>The entire Apple //e state is saved to a human-readable (.yaml) file.</p>
		<p><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">1</span>
		    The following are persisted to the file:
		    <ul>
		        <li>Apple model: ][, ][+, //e, Enhanced //e or clone (eg. Pravets)</li>
		        <li>Apple ]['s slot-0 language card: 16K Language Card, Saturn 64K or Saturn 128K</li>
		        <li>Apple //e's auxiliary card: 80 Column, Extended 80 Column or RamWorks III</li>
		        <li>Disk][ (even during r/w operation)</li>
		        <li>Hard disk (even during r/w operation)</li>
		        <li>Mockingboard</li>
		        <li>Phasor</li>
		        <li>Mouse card</li>
		        <li>CP/M SoftCard</li>
		        <li>Parallel Printer card</li>
		        <li>Super Serial card</li>
		    </ul>
		    The following are not yet persisted to the file:
		    <ul>
		        <li>Uthernet card</li>
		        <li>SAM card</li>
		        <li>No-Slot clock (there's nothing to persist)</li>
				<li>Using The Freeze's F8 ROM</li>
				<li>Alternate F8 ROM</li>
				<li>Alternate video ROM</li>
		    </ul>
		<p>Note: Only the file names of the disk images are stored in the .yaml file (not the 
			full path). This allows you to move your disk image around or distribute them. 
			If AppleWin can't locate the disk image(s), then it will prompt for the new 
			location.</p>
		<p>NB. Loading of the old v1 file format (.aws file) is no longer supported. Use AppleWin 1.27.13 to load it at the AppleWin start-up/logo screen,
		then immediately save it (and it'll be saved in the v2 format).</p>
