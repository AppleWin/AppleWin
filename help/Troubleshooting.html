		<p style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Here is a list of issues and possible solutions:</p>

		Uthernet network card not working.
		<ul>
		<li>There are problems when running with certain firewalls (eg. ZoneAlarm).
			<ul>
			<li>See the Uthernet network card section for details.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		</ul>

		AppleWin doesn't startup.
		<ul>
		<li>It could be being blocked by your anti-virus software. There is a known problem with Constant Guard Protection Suite.
			<ul>
			<li>From your anti-virus software, unblock AppleWin to allow it to run.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		</ul>

		When using a non-US (or UK) keyboard, certain keys can't be typed.
		<ul>
		<li>AltGr (or right Alt) needs to be used to type certain keys, eg:
			<ul>
			<li>'@' is AltGr+2 (for a Canadian-French keyboard).</li>
			<li>'[' is AltGr+é (for an Italian keyboard).</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Some games or productivity software have an action based on the Open Apple (Alt) or Solid Apple (AltGr) keys, eg:
			<ul>
			<li>Lode Runner uses CTRL+@ to increase the lives.</li>
			<li>AppleLogo // and AppleWorks 5.1 have problems when using an Italian keyboard.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>This dual function for AltGr (to both type a key and emulate Solid Apple) can cause problems such that the key (eg. '@') can never be typed.</li>
		<li>The workaround is to use the `-no-hook-alt` command line switch and configure Joystick 1 = "Keyboard (numpad)"; and then use the '0' and '.' keys for Open/Solid Apple.</li>
		</ul>

		No Apple II speaker sound, but Mockingboard sound is working!
		<ul>
		<li>Check the Volume Control for the Speaker, under the <a href="cfg-sound.html">Configuration->Sound tab</a>.</li>
		<li>Try installing the Realtek-specific audio driver supplied by ASUS (as opposed to the default Win10 driver).</li>
		</ul>
