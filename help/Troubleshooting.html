		<p style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Here is a list of issues and possible solutions:</p>

		How to reset AppleWin back to the default settings:
		<ul>
		<li>Within the AppleWin install folder there is the file: DELREG.INF.</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Windows 10/11: From Explorer, right click on this file, then select: Install</li>
		</ul>
		<li>This will remove all AppleWin configuration from the Registry.</li>
		</ul>

		<br>
		Uthernet network card not working.
		<ul>
		<li>There are problems when running with certain firewalls (eg. ZoneAlarm).
			<ul>
			<li>See the Uthernet network card section for details.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		</ul>

		<br>
		AppleWin doesn't startup.
		<ul>
		<li>It could be being blocked by your anti-virus software. There is a known problem with Constant Guard Protection Suite.
			<ul>
			<li>From your anti-virus software, unblock AppleWin to allow it to run.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		</ul>

		<br>
		When using a non-US (or UK) keyboard, certain keys can't be typed.
		<ul>
		<li>AltGr (or right Alt) needs to be used to type certain keys, eg:
			<ul>
			<li>'@' is AltGr+2 (for a Canadian-French keyboard).</li>
			<li>'[' is AltGr+é (for an Italian keyboard).</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Some games or productivity software have an action based on the Open Apple (Alt) or Solid Apple (AltGr) keys, eg:
			<ul>
			<li>Lode Runner uses CTRL+@ to increase the lives.</li>
			<li>AppleLogo // and AppleWorks 5.1 have problems when using an Italian keyboard.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>This dual function for AltGr (to both type a key and emulate Solid Apple) can cause problems such that the key (eg. '@') can never be typed.</li>
		<li>The workaround is to use the `-no-hook-alt` command line switch and configure Joystick 1 = "Keyboard (numpad)"; and then use the '0' and '.' keys for Open/Solid Apple.</li>
		</ul>

		<br>
		No Apple II speaker sound, but Mockingboard sound is working!
		<ul>
		<li>Check the Volume Control for the Speaker, under the <a href="cfg-sound.html">Configuration->Sound tab</a>.</li>
		<li>Try installing the Realtek-specific audio driver supplied by ASUS (as opposed to the default Win10 driver).</li>
		</ul>

		<br>
		Color (RGB Card/Monitor) and title compatibility issues:
		<ul>
		<li>Dragon Wars: double hi-res bit7 needs inverting, so use the -rgb-card-invert-bit7 command line switch.</li>
		<li>Renegade: switches to 160x192 mode at the title screen and then B&W (at the title screen) after game play.</li>
		<li>Apple's AppleColor card or Video7's RGB-SL7 card: corruption for titles/demos that accidentally switch to foreground/background hi-res mode, eg. French Touch DIGIDREAM demo.</li>
		</ul>

		<br>
		Can't switch to 2x windowed mode:
		<ul>
		<li>If the resolution isn't high enough to support 2x windowed mode, then AppleWin will refuse to switch.</li>
		<li>For different versions of Windows this is slightly different:</li>
			<ul>
			<li>Windows 7 requires: 1181 x 808</li>
			<li>Windows 10 (1909) requires: 1181 x 818</li>
			<li>Windows 11 (23H2) requires: 1177 x 805</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>
		
		<br>
		Can't set bookmark 0 in the debugger / CTRL+SHIFT+0 not working:
		<img style="FLOAT: right;" src="img/Change Key Sequence.png" alt="Configuration settings" hspace="5" vspace="5">		
		<ul>
		<li>Windows 7: From "Control Panel...":</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Windows 7: Change keyboards or other input methods -> 'Keyboards and Languages' tab -> Change Keyboards -> 'Advanced Key Settings' -> Change Key Sequence...</li>
		</ul>
		</ul>

		<ul>
		<li>Windows 10: From "Control Panel...":</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Windows 10: Typing -> Advanced Keyboard Settings -> Input language hot keys -> Change Key Sequence...</li>
		</ul>
		</ul>

		<ul>
		<li>Windows 11: From "Settings":</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Time & Language -> Typing -> Advanced Keyboard Settings -> Input language hot keys -> Change Key Sequence...</li>
		</ul>
		</ul>

		<ul>
		<li>Finally set "Switch Keyboard Layout" to "Not Assigned".</li>
		</ul>

		<br>
		.po floppy image doesn't boot and may crash to the monitor.
		<ul>
		<li>Try renaming with a ".do" or ".dsk" extension.</li>
		<li>Or you can use a utility like CiderPress to convert them to proper .po disks and then they will work correctly in emulators and with ProDOS block devices.</li>
		<li> Details:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>".do" and ".po" specify a specific order.</li>
			<li>These non-booting .po images are with DOS-order sectors.</li>
		</ul>
		</ul>
