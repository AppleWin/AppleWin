<hr size="4">
<p>To create a new disk image,
all you have to do is tell AppleWin to use an image file which doesn't
already exist and the emulator will automatically create a new image
file.&nbsp; Specifying a new disk image is like inserting a blank,
unformatted floppy disk into a real drive.&nbsp; This means that
the image must be formatted by emulator before it can be used.
Specifically, this is what you'd do using DOS 3.3:</p>

<ol>

  <li>Load a master DOS 3.3 disk
image in drive 1 and boot the emulated Apple. </li>

  <li>Click on the Drive 1
toolbar button. </li>

  <li>Instead of selecting a disk
image from the list, type in a name for a new disk image and press
enter. </li>

  <li>Type in a program that you
want DOS to run whenever this new disk is booted. A simple but useful
program is:<br>

    <br>

    <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">10
PRINT
CHR$(4);"CATALOG"</span><font face="Courier New"><br>

    </font><br>

  </li>

  <li>Type <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">"INIT
HELLO"</span> to initialize (format) the disk image. </li>

</ol>

<p>You now have a working disk
image, which you can use to save documents or other information. If you
want to fill this image with data from a real floppy disk that you
have, then you need to "transfer" the disk's data. See the <a href="ddi-transfer.html">Transferring
Disk Images</a> topic for more information. </p>

<p>Please note that not all disk image types supported by
AppleWin can be created in this manner.&nbsp; Since there is no way
to detect the image type from the image itself, it is determined by the
given file extension only. Four extensions are allowed: (.DSK, .DO,
.NIB, .WOZ). The first two create a "DOS Order Image", .NIB creates
a "Nibble Image" and .WOZ creates an empty .WOZ image.&nbsp; If the extension is completely omitted,
".DSK" will be chosen by default.&nbsp; For more information, see <a href="ddi-formats.html">Disk Image Formats</a>.</p>
