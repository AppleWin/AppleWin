		<p style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Overview:</p>
		<p>Emulation can be run in full-speed (aka unthrottled) mode.</p>

		<p style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Details:</p>
		<p>This can be enabled manually or automatically in a variety of ways:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Permanently enable by the AppleWin <a href="cfg-config.html">Configuration</a> tab's 'Emulation Speed Control', and setting 'Custom Speed (in MHz)' to 'Fastest'.
			<li>Scroll Lock key: can be configured to toggle normal/full-speed mode, or only enable full-speed when pressed.
			<ul>
				<li>See <a href="cfg-input.html">Input</a> for configuring how Scroll Lock behaves.
			</ul>
			<li>When 'Disk access speed' is set to 'Enhanced Speed' (the default), then whenever the Disk][ drive motor is on, the emulator will automatically switch to full-speed (and when the motor is switched off, then the emulator will automatically revert to what the 'Emulation Speed Control' has been set to).
			<ul>
				<li>See <a href="cfg-disk.html">Disk</a> for configuring 'Disk access speed'.
			</ul>
			<li>From the built-in debugger, single-stepping via the 'gg' command.
		</ul>

		<p style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Limitations and things to bear in mind:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Full speed mode favours speed over video accuracy:
			<ul>
				<li>The Apple II's video is only updated periodically (once a wall-clock 60Hz frame) instead of each opcode.
			</ul>
			<li>All sound (speaker, Mockingboard, etc) is muted.
			<li>Video-based timing/synchronisation loops won't work correctly.
			<ul>
				<li>The video-scanner won't advance its h/v position, so it will always returns the last value.
				<li>Specifically code that does Apple II+ VBlank detection (using the floating bus) will hang, until full-speed mode is disabled. (But Apple //e soft-switch VBlank detection does work.)
			</ul>
			<li>Card detection routines (that rely on floating bus) won't work correctly.
			<li>One of your PC's CPU cores will run at 100%.
			<ul>
				<li>EG. Simply boot the Apple II (or //e) without a disk in drive-1.
			</ul>
		</ul>
