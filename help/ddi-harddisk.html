<hr size="4">
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Overview:</p>

<p>A hard disk controller (or interface) card can be plugged in to slot 7 via the AppleWin Configuration tab labelled Disk.
Just check <span style="font-style: italic;">Enable hard disk controller in slot 7</span>.</p>

<p>There is provision to connect two hard disks to this card.
This is done by using .hdv or 800KB .2mg files on your PC.
Each hard disk can have a maximum capacity of 32MB.</p>
NB. The hard disk controller supports both fixed-disk types (up to 32MB) and 3.5" floppy types (800KB).

<p>On booting, the Apple will <span style="text-decoration: underline;">always</span>
attempt to
autoboot from slot 7 first. If the hard disk card is unplugged (not
enabled) then
the Apple will then attempt to boot from slot 6 (with the Disk][
interface card in it).</p>

<p>To boot a floppy disk with the hard disk card enabled, either hold down the Open-Apple key during an Apple II restart or
issue PR#6 from an AppleSoft prompt.</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;">Warnings:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Unchecking <span style="font-style: italic;">Enable hard disk controller in slot 7</span> whilst the Apple is running will
physically unplugging the hard disk card. This can lead to a corrupt
.hdv image if the Apple is writing to the hard disk when it is unplugged!</li>

  <li>Equally, exiting AppleWin
can have the same affect.</li>

  <li>Copy][+ v7.1 locks up when
trying to calculate how many free blocks are available when running a
catalog. This is a bug in Copy][+ which is fixed in later versions.</li>

</ul>
