<h3>Floppy Controller Settings:</h3>
<p><strong>Disk Access Speed:</strong><br>
Here you can choose the speed at which the system can access
an emulated floppy disk drive.
By default, you would want "Enhanced Speed" so that data can
be accessed as fast as possible. However, it is also possible that
certain programs might depend on the "Authentic Speed" to function
properly. This is the speed at which the real hardware
would&nbsp;access data from your drives.</p>


<p><strong>Select Disk 1/2:</strong><br>


These buttons allow you to select floppy disk images (.dsk files) to
'insert' into the
emulated floppy drives 1 and 2. &nbsp;This can also be done during emulation by <a href="toolbar.html">using the toolbar</a> or using the F3/F4 keys. Diskettes can be swapped by pressing F5 during emulation.</p>


<h3>Harddisk Controller Settings:</h3>
<p><strong>Enable harddisk in slot 7:</strong><br>
A harddisk interface card can be plugged in to slot-7 by checking this
box. You can connect two harddisks to this card by selecting .hdv files
on your PC. Each harddisk can have a maximum capacity of 32MB.
</p>
<p>On booting, the Apple will <span style="text-decoration: underline;">always</span> attempt to autoboot from slot-7 
first. If the harddisk card is unplugged (not enabled)&nbsp;the Apple will then 
attempt to boot from slot-6 (this has the Disk][ floppy interface card in it). To boot a 
floppy disk with the harddisk card enabled, you can issue PR#6 from an AppleSoft 
prompt.</p>

<p>You can download sample .hdv images from Asimov (eg. <a href="ftp://public.asimov.net/pub/apple_II/" target="_blank">ftp://public.asimov.net/pub/apple_II/images/utility/misc/hardpc.zip</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Select HDD1/HDD2:</strong><br>


These buttons allow you to select harddisk images (.hdv files) to
connect to the emulated hard drive controller.</p>
<strong>Harddisk warnings:</strong>
<ul>


  <li>Unchecking <em>enable
harddisk in slot 7</em> while the emulator is running would be
like physically unplugging the harddisk card on an Apple that is
powered on.
This can lead to a corrupt .hdv image if the Apple is writing to the
harddisk when it is unplugged! </li>


  <li>Also, exiting AppleWin while writing to the harddisk can
have the same effect. </li>


  <li>The harddisk state is currently <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> saved
in the save-state
image. </li>


  <li>Copy][+ v7.1 locks up when trying to calculate how many
free blocks are available when running a catalog. This is a bug in
Copy][+ which is fixed in later versions.</li>


</ul>
