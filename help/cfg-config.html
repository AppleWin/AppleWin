		<strong>Model:</strong><br>
		This describes the mode of emulation. &nbsp;You have the option of emulating 
		the predecessors of the Apple //e: the Apple ][ and Apple ][+. Besides running 
		with a different Apple system ROM, some differences are discussed below.<br>
		<ul>
			<li>Apple ][ : 48K non-autostarting, Integer BASIC, no lower-case, no 80-column, 6502 CPU
			<li>Apple ][+ : 64K autostarting, Applesoft BASIC version of the Apple ][
			<li>Apple //e : 128K machine, lower-case, 80-column, 6502 CPU</li>
			<li>Enhanced Apple //e : 128K machine, lower-case, 80-column, 65C02 CPU</li>
			<li>Clone (specific model selectable from Advanced page)</li>
		</ul>

		<strong>Confirm reboot:</strong><br>
		Show "Confirm reboot" message box when F2 is pressed.<br>
		<br>

		<strong>Video:</strong><br>
		AppleWin can display Apple video in a variety of modes. The display can also be 
		run in a standard window or full-screen. This option describes the type of 
		video emulation to be used for the emulator. The differences are 
		discussed below.<br>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Monochrome (custom) :</strong>&nbsp;This mode emulates a monochrome monitor.<br>
			You can choose your monochrome color from the <em>Monochrome Color</em>	button described below.
			<li><strong>Color (RGB Monitor) :</strong>&nbsp;This mode emulates a standard RBG color monitor.
			<br>Text is sharp like a white monochrome monitor. Color graphics has only 16 colors (with no blurring or ringing).
			<li><strong>Color (NTSC Monitor) :</strong>&nbsp;This mode emulates a standard NTSC color monitor.
			<br>Text is sharp, but contains color artifacts. Color graphics has visible alternating color and black pixels.
			<li><strong>Color TV :</strong>&nbsp;This mode emulates an NTSC color TV.
			<br>All text and color graphics modes are blurry and have visible ringing.
			<li><strong>B&W TV :</strong>&nbsp;This mode emulates an NTSC black and white TV.
			<li><strong>Monochrome (Amber/Green/White) :</strong>&nbsp;Monochrome with specified color.
		</ul>

		<strong>Monochrome Color:</strong><br>
		This is the color to use when you choose a monochrome video mode.<br>
		<br>

		<strong>50% Scan lines:</strong><br>
		Only draw alternate scanline (for better monitor authenticity).<br>
		<br>

		<strong>Vertical blend:</strong><br>
		When video mode is 'Color (RGB Monitor)' then vertically blend the hires screen.<br>
		<br>

		<strong>Full-Screen: Show drive/keyboard status:</strong><br>
		When in full-screen mode, show floppy (activity and track) and harddisk status (activity); keyboard caps-lock status and if emulation is paused.<br>
		<br>

		<strong>Serial Port:</strong><br>
		This option will remap the emulated Apple's serial port to your PC's serial port (or TCP port 1977).<br>
		See <a href="card-ssc.html">Super Serial Card</a> for more details.<br>
		<br>

		<strong>Ethernet Settings...:</strong><br>
		This allows to choose which network interface card (NIC) you want to 
		use with the Uthernet card.<br>
		<br>

		<strong>Emulation Speed Control:</strong><br>
		This option let's you control the processor speed of the emulated system. You 
		may choose to use an authentic speed (matching the speed of the original 
		processor from the system) or you can underclock or overclock the emulated 
		processor speed from half-speed to as fast as your PC can emulate.<br>
		<br>

		<strong>50Hz video:</strong><br>
		When checked, this option will run the emulated machine with a 50Hz(PAL) video refresh rate.
		The default is unchecked, for 60Hz(NTSC).<br>
		<br>

		<strong>Benchmark Emulator:</strong><br>
		This will run a benchmark test that will show how fast your PC can emulate an 
		Apple //e system with this emulator. In order to run the benchmark, the 
		emulated machine must be reset and you will lose any unsaved work. You will be 
		prompted before you continue this action. The results given are:<br>
		<ul>
			<li> Pure Video FPS
			<li> Pure CPU MHz (video update)
			<li> Pure CPU MHz (full-speed)
			<li> Expected average video game performance (in FPS)
		</ul>
