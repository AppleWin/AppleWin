This describes the mode of emulation. &nbsp;You have the option of
emulating the predecessor of the Apple //e, the Apple ][+.
Besides running with a different Apple system ROM, some
differences are discussed below.<br>

<ul>

  <li>Apple ][+ : 64K machine, no lower-case, no 80-column, 6502
CPU</li>

  <li>Apple //e : 128K machine, lower-case, 80-column, 65C02 CPU</li>

</ul>

<strong>Video:</strong><br>

AppleWin can display Apple video in a variety of modes. The
display can also be run in a standard window or full-screen.
This option describes the type of video emulation to be
used for the emulator. Some differences might be
discussed below.<br>

<ul>

  <li><strong>Monochrome :</strong>&nbsp;This
mode emulates a monochrome monitor. You can choose your monochrome
color from the <em>Monochrome Color</em> button described
below.</li>

  <li><strong>Color (standard) :</strong>&nbsp;This
mode emulates a standard color monitor.</li>

  <li><strong>Color (text optimized) :</strong>&nbsp;This
mode does a bit of image processing to make text more readable on the
hires screen.</li>

  <li><strong>Color (TV emulation) :</strong>&nbsp;This
mode emulates how colors would bleed into one another on a
TV. On the hires screen, alternating horizontal lines of color
are bled together to form new colors like grey, purple, pink, yellow
and aquamarine. This effect was used in commercial games like Karateka
and many hires adventures (eg. Mindshadow).
  </li>

</ul>

<strong>Serial Port:<br>

</strong>This option will remap the emulated Apple's serial port
to your PC's serial port.<br>

<br>

<strong>Monochrome Color:</strong><br>

This is the color to use when you choose a monochrome video mode.<br>

<br>

<strong>Emulation Speed Control:</strong><br>

This option let's you control the processor speed of the emulated
system. You may choose to use an authentic speed (matching
the speed of the original processor from the system) or you can underclock
or overclock the emulated processor speed from half-speed to as fast as
your PC can emulate.<br>

<br>

<strong>Benchmark Emulator:</strong><br>

This will run a benchmark test that will show how fast your PC can
emulate an Apple //e system with this emulator. &nbsp;In order to
run the benchmark, the emulated machine must be reset and you will lose any
unsaved work. You will be prompted before you continue this
action. The results given are:<br>

<ul>

  <li>Pure Video FPS</li>

  <li>Pure CPU MHz</li>

  <li>Expected average video game performance (in FPS)</li>

</ul>
