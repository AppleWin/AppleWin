<hr size="4">

<p>You may be wondering why there are various disk sizes.  AppleWin supports floppy disk and hard drive images.</p>

<br>
<ul>
  <li>A standard 5.25" floppy disk normally has 35 tracks. This disk can hold 140 KB.</li>

  <li>An extended 5.25" floppy disk may have up to 40 tracks. This disk can hold 160 KB.</li>

  <li>When the Apple //c+ came out it came with a 3.5" floppy disk drive. This disk can hold 800 KB. Vanilla Apple DOS 3.3 does NOT support this larger disk size; you must use another Operating System such as ProDOS.</li>

  <li>Hard drives can hold even more data; the maximum size under ProDOS is 32 MB.  Vanilla Apple DOS 3.3 does NOT support this larger disk size; you must use another Operating System such as ProDOS.</li>
</ul>
