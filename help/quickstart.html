<p>AppleWin runs Apple II
programs from disk
images, which are single files that contain the contents of an
entire Apple floppy disk.</p>

<p>Starting an Apple program is a simple two step process: </p>

<ol>

  <li>Click the Drive 1 button on
the toolbar and select a disk image file.</li>

  <li>Click the Run button on the
toolbar to boot that disk.</li>

</ol>

<p>After booting, you may use the emulated
Apple exactly as you would use a real Apple.</p>

<p>Of course, using an Apple is not much fun
unless you have a library of Apple programs to run, so you'll
probably want to get some disk images right away. The easiest way
to do that is to download images from the Internet; see the <a href="resources.html">Resources</a> section for more
information. Or, if you want
to learn more about creating your own disk images, see the <a href="diskimages.html">Disks
and Disk Images</a> section. </p>
