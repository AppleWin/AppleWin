<strong>Joystick Control:</strong><br>

These options allow you to configure up to two joysticks attached to
the emulated Apple //e system.<br>

<ul>
  <li>Joystick 1/2: Choose the emulation method for joysticks 1 and 2.</li>
  <li>X/Y-trim: &nbsp;These controls&nbsp;add a trim value to the
joystick X/Y offsets when the joystick is centered. Normally central
position is X=127, Y=127 so this adds the trim value for PC joysticks
&amp; keyboard (centering). If you are using an analog PC joystick,
then you should leave these values at 0.</li>
  <li>Allow cursor keys to be read from keyboard: Applicable only in 'Keyboard (cursors)' mode.</li>
  <li>NB.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Be aware that 'cursor-up' = CTRL+K, and 'cursor-down' = CTRL+J.</li>
    <li>When cursor keys are used for joystick emulation <strong>and</strong> are allowed to be read from the keyboard, then some games won't work correctly (eg. Lode Runner).</li>
	<li>When cursor keys are blocked from being read from the keyboard, then simple command-line cursor editing in AppleSoft won't work.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Auto-fire (all 3 buttons): For each button pressed, the button's state will be toggled when read.</li>
  <li>Keyboard auto-centering: When keys used for joystick emulation are released then the joystick will return to the central position.</li>
</ul>


<strong>Scroll Lock acts as toggle for full-speed CPU:</strong><br>
<ul>
  <li>When checked, you can permanently enable full-speed CPU when Scroll Lock is on.</li>
  <li>When unchecked, only when Scroll Lock is depressed will you get full-speed CPU.</li>
</ul>


<strong>Mouse interface in slot 4:</strong><br>
<ul>
  <li>Disables joystick emulation with mouse.</li>
  <li>Disables Mockingboard/Phasor in slot 4.</li>
  <li>Show crosshairs in window's frame:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Configure whether you want crosshairs or not</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Restrict mouse to Apple window:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Resticting is useful for paint applications</li>
    <li>When unrestricted, the emulated mouse is fully integrated with the Window desktop:
moving in and out of the AppleWin window will switch between Windows' and the Apple's mouse cursor.</li>
    <li>NB. Even when unrestricted, you won't be able to move the mouse outside the Apple window for GEOS. This is not a bug.</li>
    <li>Tip: Use Ctrl+Left Mouse Button to show the Windows mouse cursor (eg. essential for GEOS).</li>
  </ul>
</ul>


<strong>Microsoft CP/M SoftCard interface in slot 4 or 5:</strong><br>
<ul>
  <li>Emulates a CP/M card, complete with full Z80 emulation.</li>
  <li>Available when Mockingboard or Phasor isn't in slot 4 or 5.</li>
</ul>


<strong>Paste from clipboard:</strong><br>
Pressing this button will allow you to paste text from the
Windows' clipboard into the emulated Apple //e.<br>
