=-> Freeze's F-8 ROM &nbsp;A PPG release <-=<br>
=-------------------------------------=<br>

&nbsp;The Freeze's F-8 ROM is a modified F-8<br>
rom that has several added features.<br><br>

-Old Monitor Reset<br>
-Step and Trace modes<br>
-Disassembly with ASCII<br>
-Disassembly with Binary in #Mode<br>
-Better sounding bell!<br><br>

&nbsp;These advanced features make Monitor<br>
programming and Cracking much easier.<br><br>

&nbsp;There are two ways you can use this<br>
program. Either load it into the RAM<br>
Card using the FREEZE.INSTALL program.<br>
The other way is to burn it onto a<br>
2716 EPROM (Schematics later).<br><br>

&nbsp;The only thing that really need an<br>
explanation is the disassembly. In the<br>
disassembly, it displays the ASCII<br>
value of the byte to the right. The<br>
binary numbers on the far right are<br>
displayed when an instruction on the<br>
accumulator in immediate mode is<br>
encountered.<br><br>

2716 Schematics<br>
===============<br><br>

&nbsp;I would suggest that you do these<br>
modifications to a socket rather than<br>
directly to the chip...<br><br>

&nbsp;First, cut off pins 21 and 18.<br>
Connect pins 12 and 18<br>
Connect pins 21 and 24<br>
