Disk Images</h2>

<hr size="4">
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Serial Line Transfers:</p>

<p>The most common method of transferring disk
images is through a serial line. To do this, you must connect
your Apple to your PC with a serial line and null modem, then run
one program on the Apple which reads data off the disk and sends
it out over the serial line, and another program on the PC which
collects data from the serial line and saves it to a disk image
file. This system can be difficult to set up initially, but once
it is working it is very fast and convenient.</p>
<p>
Common programs for doing this work are ADT and ADTPro:</p>
<ul>
<li>Apple Disk Transfer (ADT) - <a target="_blank" href="http://adt.berlios.de">http://adt.berlios.de</a>
 - runs natively on Windows, but is limited to transferring 5-1/4" disks.</li>
<li>Apple Disk Transfer ProDOS (ADTPro) - <a target="_blank" href="http://adtpro.sourceforge.net/connectionsserial.html">http://adtpro.sourceforge.net/connectionsserial.html</a>
 - requires Java, but is capable of transferring all disk types and sizes.</li>
</ul>

<p style="font-weight: bold;">Audio Transfers:</p>
Apples with audio (cassette) jacks can transfer disk images
via those ports through audio jacks on a PC.
This method is considerably slower than using a serial line,
but may be used if 
the Apple in question lacks a serial port, for example.
Common programs for doing this work are ADTPro and Arme Leute Apple Disk Transfer:</p>

</ul>


<p style="font-weight: bold;">Ethernet Transfers:</p>
Apples with an <a href="http://a2retrosystems.com/">A2RetroSystems</a> Uthernet
card can transfer disk images via ADTPro:

</ul>



<p style="font-weight: bold;">Modem Transfers:</p>

<p>If you have a modem and
terminal program on
both your Apple and PC, you can take advantage of that to
transfer disks with very little initial setup. Here's what you
do:</p>

<ol>

  <li>Run ShrinkIt! on the Apple
to compress a disk image into a single archive file.</li>

  <li>Transfer that file over the
modem to your PC.</li>

  <li>Run Nulib on the PC to
uncompress the archive file. Nulib is available from
    <a target="_blank" href="ftp://public.asimov.net/pub/apple_II/utility/nulib">ftp://public.asimov.net/pub/apple_II/utility/nulib</a>.</li>

</ol>

<p style="font-weight: bold;">Transferring
Through 3.5"
Disks:</p>

<p>One final way to transfer disk
images is to
copy the data onto a 3.5" disk, and then use a Macintosh to
transfer the data from the 3.5" disk into a PC readable
format. The advantage of this method is that it does not require
a serial card or modem. However, it does involve a number of
steps:</p>

<ol>

  <li>Run dsk2file on an Apple
IIgs. This will read an entire 5 1/4" disk and save it as a single file
on a 3.5" ProDOS disk.</li>

  <li>Take the 3.5" disk to a
Macintosh and copy the file using Apple File Exchange or the ProDOS
File System Extension.</li>

  <li>Format a high density 3.5"
disk on a PC.</li>

  <li>Take this 3.5" disk to the
Macintosh and write the image file to it using Apple File Exchange or
PC Exchange.</li>

</ol>
