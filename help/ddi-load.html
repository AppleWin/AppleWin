Disk Images</h2>

<hr size="4">
<p>AppleWin registers the
following file types as "Disk
Images": *.do, *.dsk, *.nib, and *.po.&nbsp; Double-clicking
a disk image in the Windows Explorer will automatically load and boot
the disk.
While older versions of
AppleWin started a new
instance of the emulator for every disk started in this manner, current
versions
of the emulator will simply replace the current disk if there is an
instance of
the emulator already running.</p>

<p>You may also drag and drop a
disk image from an Explorer
window to the AppleWin emulator window to load and boot the
disk.&nbsp; Dropping the image exactly on one of the drive buttons
will insert
it only into this drive
without booting.&nbsp; For
example: drop "Pascal1.dsk" to drive 1 and "Pascal2.dsk" to
drive 2, then click the the Run button to bring up UCSD Pascal.</p>

<p>AppleWin now allows you to
open a disk as read-only.&nbsp;
To do this, click the checkbox for "Open as Read Only" in the Select
Disk Image dialog.&nbsp; This works like the physical
write-protection mechanism on a real Apple //e floppy disk.</p>

<p>If a Disk Image name is to
long to read in the Toolbar,
simply pause the mouse cursor over a drive button to get a
tool-tip with the full name.</p>
