Apple II emulator for Windows with Remote Control

This fork of AppleWin is focused on adding remote control capabilities to AppleWin. The first supported remote control technique is "Game Link", created by Grid Cartographer, a commercial map making application. Any 3rd party app can interface with AppleWin using Game Link, which is a relatively simple shared-memory based communication protocol. Documentation on how to code for Game Link is available within the AppleWin source code.
