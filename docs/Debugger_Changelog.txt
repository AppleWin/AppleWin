2.8.0.0 Released with AppleWin 1.25

2.7.0.#
.36 Fixed: empty command was re-triggering previous command. Example: DW 6062, // test
.35 Added: DW address -- round the length up to even number for convenience. Example: DW 6062 is equivalent to: DW 6062:6063
.34 Fixed: Unified auto-defined name: B_, W_, T_ for byte, word, or text respectively
.33 Fixed: ASC range -- auto-define symbol name: T_####
.32 Fixed: DW range -- auto-define symbol name: W_####
.31 Fixed: DB range -- auto-define symbol name B_####
.30 Fixed: ASC overflowing sOpCodes in FormatOpcodeBytes()
.29 Added: Help for DB and DW
.28 Added: ASC so it disassemblies intertwined code and data correctly.
    Example:
        using Castle Wolfenstien.DSK
        BLOAD ^VOCAB
        ASC name1 17DA:17F5
.27 Added: DB address now auto-defines the symbol D_####
.26 Changed: DS to ASC because DS is used as "Define Space" assembler directive
.25 Fixed : DW address so that odd address work.
    i.e. DW NEXT1 801   // AppleSoft Basic Line#1 Pointer to Next line

2.7.0.17 Released with Applewin 1.20.0.0

.17 Fixed: HELP <category> wasn't displaying when category was one of: FLAGS, OUTPUT, WATCHES
.16 Fixed: WL was displaying number of watches
.15 Fixed: Memory Dump was over-writing watches.
.14 Added: Debugger display flag to update soft switches. (Related to .12)
.13 Fixed: Targets of PC instruction weren't displaying.
.12 Fixed: Fixed scrolling to only update the diasm window.
.11 Fixed: Breakpoints and Watches no longer disappear.
.10 Added: Watches now show (dynamic) raw hex bytes
    Changed: Lowered watches down from 16 to 8.

 .9 Fixed: Bookmarks weren't initialized to zero.
 .8 Added: New command PWD to display the current debugger directory.
    This is the directory used for scripts, loading/saving memory, and trace files.
    Currently the debugger uses the same directory that the last disk image was loaded from.
    It will have its own directory in a future version.
 .7 Fixed: Cleaned up display of soft-switches to show address.
 .6 Removed: Unused aliases.
    Reason: When a symbol table is specified with no args, the total # of symbols will be shown.
    SYMBOLS1, SYMBOLS2, SYM0, SYM1, SYM2, SYM3, SYM4, SYM5, SYM6 
 .5 Fixed: Increased console output height so that you can view all the SYMBASIC * output.

2.7.0.0 Released with Applewin 1.19.1.0


.33 Fixed: Define Address should be shown as Absolute mode, not Indirect Absolute mode.
    Example:
       U D000
       DA BASIC.FPTR D000:D081 // was showing as "da (END-1)" now shows as "da END-1"
.32 Fixed: n'th Search results were being displayed in dec, yet parser takes hex numbers.
    Example:
       SH D000:FFFF A9 00
       U @A // used to show 10th search result as 10:DE60, now 0A:DE60
.31 Fixed: Disasm list containing data address table was bailing on first possible match.
    Example:
       DA BASIC.FPTR D000:D080
       U D000 // was showing da STOP+1, instead of END-1
.30 Added: DA now works!  It is similar to DW except it does symbol lookups!
    (DW = Define Word.  DA = Define Address)
    Example:
       U D000
       DA BASIC.FPTR D000:D080
.29 Fixed: Pretty print DB2 DB4 DB8 without commas
.28 Fixed: DB2 DB4 DB8 DW DW2 DW4 now work/display properly.
    DB (Define Byte) shows bytes in big endian order.
    DW (Define Word) shows addresses (2 bytes) in little endian order.
    Example:
       U D000
       DB2 REV.FPTR D000:D080
       X
       DW BASIC.FPT D000:D080
       X
    Or for those minimal types who hate wasting screen real estate
        DW4 COMPACT D000:D080
        X
        DB8 RA8 D000:D080
        X
.27 Fixed: Don't do symbol look up for data bytes that don't request it. (Groundwork for Define Address)
.26 Changed: Code portability. Slowly remove the LPCTSTR taint of Windowisms.
.25 Fixed: DB DW custom data byte sizes weren't scrolling properly in the disasm view.
    Changed _6502_GetOpmodeOpbyte() to be aware of data bytes.
.24 Changed: 2.6.2.24 Changed: Tone-downed the alt. background cyan for the DATA window. C2, C3 -> C1,C2
.23 Changed: Increased number of lines for console output buffer (from 384 to 512)
.22 Changed: Re-enabled magenta/purple for warnings (i.e. symbol table disabled)
.21 Fixed: Missing GPL / copyright on some debugger files, updated year.
.20 Changed: Output of found symbol more table friendly.  Symbol table name displayed first.
    Example: SYM HOME     // <SymbolTable>:  $<Address> <Symbol>
.19 Changed: Unified format & colors for summary of symbol tables and symbol table names.
    A symbol table that has been disabled will display in purple / magenta.
    Example: SYM HOME     // 'Main' shown in yellow
    Example: SYMBASIC OFF
    Example: SYM
.18 Fixed: Search Results: Total summary line unified colors.
.17 Fixed: Search Results: The n'th result now using correct color (was command, now number decimal)
.16 Fixed: Search Results: The hex literal prefix '$' for target address results now colorized properly.
.15 Fixed: Search Results: Added space between results for better readability.
.14 Fixed: Help description for Save/Load parameter help was swapped.
    Example: HELP SYMMAIN
.13 Added: Can now enable/disable selected symbol table(s) !
    Example: SYMMAIN OFF
    Example: SYMBASIC OFF
    Note: If you need to search for symbols ON, OFF, CLEAR, use SYM. i.e. SYM ON.
.12 Fixed: Following symbol tables were all hard-coded to act on SYMMAIN
		SYMBASIC
		SYMASM
		SYMUSER
		SYMUSER2
		SYMSRC
		SYMSRC2
	Example: SYMBASIC CLEAR
.11 Added: Command line now accepts Indirect mode via ( )
    Example:  U (BRKV)
.10 Added: Pretty printing 'B' of all bytes treated as data.
.9 Fixed: Renamed ambiguous command 'DL' to 'B' to list all bytes being treated as data
          Renamed command: 'B' to 'Z' as an alias to treat byte(s) as data
.8 Fixed: Define Code 'X' wasn't removing entries
.7 Fixed: DATA1 was using call win setup for code, not data.
.6 Cleanup of command table to have the proper internal command enum.
		D      // CMD_MEM_MINI_DUMP_HEX_1 moved to alias section
		M1     // CMD_MEM_MINI_DUMP_HEX_1 moved to alias section
		M2     // CMD_MEM_MINI_DUMP_HEX_2 moved to alias section
		TEXT81 // CMD_VIEW_TEXT81         <- CMD_VIEW_TEXT8X
		TEXT82 // CMD_VIEW_TEXT82         <- CMD_VIEW_TEXT8X
		W      // CMD_WATCH               <- CMD_WATCH_ADD
.5 Added: Internal consistency checking for commands and their internal command enum.
.4 Fixed: Added custom assembler type and debugger disassembly display uses variable
          instead of always being hard-coded to Merlin directives.
.5 Fixed: Data disassembler help -- was using wrong command help offset due to wrong order of commands.
.3 Fixed: Assembler now accepts lower-case mnemonics
.2 Fixed: help for command '@'
.1 Added: new command: 'X' to Define Code 
    Remove address being treated as data
    X                    // uses address cursor is on
	X symbol             // uses address cursor is on
	X symbol address
.0 Added: new command "DB" to Define Byte / Pseudo Mnemonic / Assembler Directive
    DB                  // uses address cursor is on
    DB symbol           // uses address cursor is on
    DB symbol address
    DB symbol start:end
    Example:
       DB zp 0:ff
