1.12.8.0 bugs:

. When running any program, when I go to reset the machine by clicking on the Apple logo again,
  it never seems to reset cleanly and a bunch of garbage usually starts cycling through the screen.
. I notice the behavior with running Maniac Mansion is still present, where if you simply select
  the Disk 1 and then start the emulator, it will get stuck shortly after accessing the disk drive
  for a moment. But if, after selecting Disk 1, I start the debugger and then issue the "G" command,
  it runs just fine.

--------------

1.12.7.2 bugs:

. FIXED: BRK opcode only pushes PC+1, not PC+2 to stack
. Rich (news-group): Merlin 8 PRODOS v2.57, type O to save object code, specify name, press return (beep beep beep beep (static, rough sounding)) 
  [Tried with 2.47 & 2.57, but can't reproduce. Have asked Rich for a save-state image just before problem]
. FLASHing in 80-col mode
. VBl IO reg not updated in 'Stepping' mode

--------------

1.12.6.0 bugs:

- I'm using a program that has some key combinations that require that both the open-apple and closed-apple keys be pressed at the same time with a key (i.e. open-apple + closed-apple + q).  This works on a real Apple II.
  . Numpad '0 + '.' + 'q' works though
  . OA + Q = Q (
  . OA + CA + Q = nothing
  . OA + CA, then release OA, then + Q = Ctrl-Q (145)
  + Alt-Gr: WM_KEYDOWN[Left Control] then WM_KEYDOWN[Right-Alt]
  [Win98(+XP?): 'Alt Gr' (Right-Alt) emits a Control key-press before the Right-Alt, so key combinations involving Closed-Apple (Right-Alt) will probably fail. Use Keypad's 'Del' instead.]

--------------

1.12.5.0 bugs:
- FIXED: In 80-column mode, the % character doesn't seem to have a slash at all, just the two dots.

From Oliver Schmidt:
- FIXED: The new tabbed dialog is quite tall - it even doesn't fit on the screen in full-screen mode. Fortunately the buttons are still accessable.
- FIXED: At least with my Windows graphics driver the mouse cursor flickers a lot when positioned over the AW window but not in full-screen mode.
  > Does this happen at all times?
  Just after booting up master.dsk and sitting "idle" at the Applesoft prompt.

When I try to switch to full screen AppleWin 1.12.5 exits without any
comment. There is no info box (about GPF), nothing. I use Win2K En SP4,
DirectX 9.0c, Matrox G400 with newest drivers

--------------

1.12.4.3 bugs:
- FIXED: Running w/out 6502 DLLs doesn't work (internal 6502 emu code is broken)
- FIXED: When in Apple][ mode, certain games crash to monitor:
  . BurgerTime, Ultima3(MB version)
  . Don't know when this bug was introduced
- Joystick Config: {Mouse, Disabled} -> {Mouse, Keyboard} does not work.
- FIXED: Incorrect chars: ~, `, {, }, %.

1.12.4.1 bugs:
- Need to check this:

Reply1:
1: It is an emulator problem.

Reply2:
I had this.  I believe I just re-ran the calibration and it went away.
However, there are more recent versions of AppleWin available.

- FIXED: PAUSE emulator. Emulator runs at full-speed for a while after un-pausing.
- Screen-saver kicks-in while playing game which only uses joystick input (ie. no KB or mouse). 
- FIXED: "Situation critical" game: key response is slow (fine with TK3000e).
- FIXED: "Olympic Decathlon" game: letters scrolling onto screen are jerky (fine with TK3000e - VBL?).
- Johnson Lam's Mock1.dsk still isn't 100%.

--------------

1.12.4.0 bugs:
- FIXED: CPU usage is 100%
- FIXED: Turning mocking board support turns Apple speaker off as well.
- Oliver Schmidt: I personally don't like the "adjusted" hires colors ;-)
- FIXED: Disk][ speed can be very slow.
- Disk speed test utils still show meaningless results (even with enhanced disk speed turned off). Check with Locksmith 6.0.
- FIXED: FLASHing text in mono-mode.

i found a crash bug. in full screen , if you move the mouse up and down the right side of the screen, it crashes without a message. i'm using win2k w/ sp4

The calibration on first boot seems to have some issues on Windows XP Pro. This is frequently reported to the newsgroups. I haven't been able to figure out why. If you can get past the calibration it works just fine.

- Win2K, DirectX9.0a & "Turtle Beach Santa Cruz" soundcard: MB output results in a horrid squeals/beep sound.
+ Sent a new build of AW (w/MAME AY8910 code). This resulted in a crash: "AW has generated errors and will be closed by Windows".

Whenever I run AppleWin in full screen mode it always eventually 
messes up (usually when i go to switch to a new game). Basically what happens is 
it shuts down, or minimizes itself preventing me from keeping it full screen. 
I've tried a couple different versions of the emulator but still have the same 
problem.

- The delreg.inf actually deleted the current user key and file assocations but failed to delete the local machine key.  The last line should read HKLM,Software\AppleWin, not HKLM,SOFTWARE\AppleWin.  The registry key is case-sensitive.  Could you please change the SOFTWARE to Software in the last line of the delreg.inf file.
- The original delreg.inf file didn't delete the AppleWin registry for the local machine because you also forgot to end the last line with the return key.  Each line including the last line must end with a return in order for the command to work.  I edited the delreg.inf file with notepad and when I move the cursor to the end of the file the cursor was sitting at the end of the last line rather than the next line where it should be.  The CRLF is missing from the last line in delreg.inf causing AppleWin to fail to delete the local machine registry key.

- Why do I get an error AppleWin is unable to initialize the sound card when I try to reconfigure the sound to use the sound card.  I have a Crystal sound chip built into the motherboard.  I'm running Windows Millennium with DirectX 9.0b.
+ -m switch fixes this.
- Why does AppleWin run very fast on my AMD K6-2/300?  I just downloaded AppleWin v1.12.3.  I tried recalibrating the emulator but it still runs too fast.  Is there any way to slow it down to the original Apple II speed?

16/01/04: Andreas Wirooks
- Soundcard doesn't work with 1.12.x (DX9.0b), but works with 1.10.4
+ Added -m switch so DirectSound isn't init'd
