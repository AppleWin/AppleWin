=============================

0. Install git

   See https://git-scm.com

1. Clone the repository

   git clone https://github.com/AppleWin/AppleWin.git

2. Visual Studio 2008 specific

   Windows SDK 7.1 is required and must be enabled through
   "Windows SDK Configuration Tool".

   Windows SDK 7.0A that comes with Visual Studio 2010 can
   also be used but the "Windows SDK Configuration Tool"
   is only available throught the separate Windows SDK 7.1
   installation.

3. Visual Studio 2008/2010/2013/2015

   Open the corresponding solution and build.

   Note that the set of solutions create output and
   intermediate files into same directores.

   So before switching to a different Visual Studio version,
   make sure doing a full clean up with the previous
   Visual Studio used.
