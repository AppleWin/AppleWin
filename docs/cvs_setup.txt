Setting up CVS for AppleWin
Revision 2
+ Added diff/merge


1. Create an account BerliOS
http://developer.berlios.de/


2. Download and install TortoiseCVS.
a) http://www.tortoisecvs.org/
b) Reboot Windows (Grr...)

If you don't want to use TortoiseCVs, you can use

i) WinCVS (which also has a Mac OS X port, called MacCVS)
http://www.wincvs.org/

ii) cvsnt:

3. Generate a SSH2 key, using "puttygen"
Recommend: using a pass-phrase
Recommend: using comment:
  <username>@shell.berlios.de

Depending on where you installed TortoiseCVS, puttgen.exe will be located there.
i.e.
 \Programs\VersionControl\TortoiseCVS\puttygen.exe

You could also optionally, install PuTTY from:
http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/

And depending on where you installed it to:
 C:\Program Files\Putty\puttgygen.exe
 P:\Programs\Util\Shell\PuTTY\puttygen.exe


4. In your home directory, make a sub-directory called: .ssh
i.e.
 C:\Document and Settings\<username>\.ssh
 \users\<username>\.ssh


5. Save your public key into your home directory
i.e.
  <username>\.ssh\identity.pub


6. Save your private key into your home directory
i.e.
 <username>\.ssh\identity


7. Upload your Public SSH key to BerliOS
a) http://developer.berlios.de/
b) Account Options
c) Edit Keys (at bottom of webpage)
d) copy from puttygen, and paste into web form
e) Verify: CVS/SVN/SSH Shared Keys: 1 <-- was zero


8. Using Windows Explorer, navigate to the parent directory where you will download AppleWin
i.e.
 <username>\Projects\


9. If you have TortoiseCVS installed, right Click on the directory, select CVS, Preferences
a) TortoiseCVS should appear. Select "Advanced"
b) Home Folder: uncheck, always recalculate home folder
c) Enter your home directory, for "Custom Home folder"


10. (Optional)
To set the environment variable "CVS_RSH" to "ssh" (without the quotes):
Right-click the My Computer icon on your desktop, Properties, Advanced, Environment variables button.


11. Setting CVSROOT.
a) If you use TortoiseCVS, right click on the AppleWin Parent directory, CVS Checkout,
and set CVSROOT to:
	:ext:<username>@cvs.applewin.berlios.de:/cvsroot/applewin

b) set Module (case sensitive!) to:
	AppleWin
c) select OK, and wait to fetch the complete AppleWin directory.

If you use another cvs client, such as WinCVS, or CVSNT, this may work:
	:ssh:<username>@cvs.applewin.berlios.de:/cvsroot/applewin

If you enter the wrong init param, you may have to rename/delete your local AppleWin folder.
If you still have problems, you may have to remove the SSH entry from the registry.
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\SimonTatham\Putty\SshHostKeys

You shouldn't have to edit, but if you do, this CVS config file is plain text:
AppleWin\CVS\Root


12. You can download a free source-code 'diff' & 'merge' app for win32
(which integrates into TortoiseCVS) from here:
http://winmerge.sourceforge.net/

Alternatively you can download a free source-code 'diff' for Win32 here:
