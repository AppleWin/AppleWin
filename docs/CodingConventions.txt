Introduction:
-------------

This doc defines a very simple set of coding guidelines to be used for AppleWin.
This ensures consistency & readability throughout the project, when worked on
by multiple developers.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Project files:

1.1: Each module to have corresponding header
EG. Debug.cpp has a corresponding Debug.h
This is for shared vars, enums, structs, classes, etc.

1.2: AppleWin.h to only be used as per 1.1

1.3: Common.h to be used for any common definitions
EG. const/enum/struct
Obviously not for global funcs or vars.

1.4: At the start of each header file it must contain: #pragma once

1.5: Each module (.cpp) to include stdafx.h, and then immediately after include
the header file for that module.
EG. For Debug.cpp:
#include "stdafx.h"
#include "Debug.h"

This ensures that this header file can be included in any order in another module,
and therefore by extension all header files can be included in any order.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2) Coding Style:

As a general rule and for consistency, adopt the coding convention/style of any module (or function) you are modifying.

2.1: Naming
For functions use upper camel case.

For variables use lower camel case.

And only if applicable, the following simplified prefix (Hungarian) style can be used:

Prefixes:
g_	: global
m_	: member
p	: pointer

Tags:
_e	: named enum definitions
_t	: struct/typedef

Also see: "Appendix: Legacy Hungarian notation"

EG:
	enum MODE_e {MODE1, MODE2, MODE2};
	MODE_e mode;
	
	struct PAIR_t
	{
		UINT a;
		UINT b;
	};

Simple loop counters (i,j,k) don't need to adhere to this style.

Naming for parameters that are being modified (eg. OUT):
It is recommended (but not mandatory) to use a suffix of OUT or '_', eg:
	bool Find(int* pFoundOUT);
	bool Find(int* pFound_);


2.2: Matching braces
These should be have same indentation, unless the braces fit neatly on one line.
EG:
	for (int i=0; i<10; i++)
	{
		// Some code
	}

2.3: Scope of module vars/funcs
If module vars/funcs aren't wrapped in a class, then declare as static if not global.

2.4: const/enum favoured over #define
Try to use const/enum instead of #define

2.4: Use of bool over BOOL
Always use bool instead of BOOL

2.5: File header
GPL header, followed by description of module & author.

2.6: Indentation
Tabs favoured over spaces.

2.7: Expression to be well spaced and parenthesised
It is recommended (but not mandatory):
. to have/use explicit parenthesis
. to have spaces between operators

Eg:
. Prefer: z = ((a + b) + 1) instead of: z=((a+b)+1)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3) Use of sprintf() etc.

Do not use sprintf(), StringCbPrintf(), wsprintf(), etc. - instead use StrFormat().

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4) Use of C++

VS2019's Platform Toolset "Visual Studio 2017 - Windows XP(v141_xp)" is used for building releases.
This is VS2017 v15.0, which includes support for C++11, C++14 and some C++17 core language support[1].

4.1: Type deduction (including auto)

Use type deduction only if it makes the code clearer to readers who aren't familiar with the project,
or if it makes the code safer. Do not use it merely to avoid the inconvenience of writing an explicit type.

e	: enum variable
h	: handle
i	: iterator (eg. UINT, STL-iterator)
m	: STL map
n	: int
r	: reference
s	: string
sg_p	: singleton
u	: unsigned int
v	: STL vector
