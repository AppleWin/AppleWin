Restrictions/bugs:
- SSI263 emulation is very basic: there is no attempt to emulate rate, inflection or filters.
- During Mockingboard playback, Speaker emulation isn't precise.
- For an original Apple //e, 80-column (PR#3) and INVERSE, it still appears to be mousetext character, but it should be inverted upper-case from $40 to $5F.

1.17.1 - 27 Nov 2009
--------------------
Changes:
. SSC: Support 115.2K Baud
. Dynamically generated 'Serial Port' drop-down menu
  - Save "Serial Port Name" to Registry (instead of drop-down menu index as "Serial Port")

1.16.1 - 21 Jun 2009
--------------------
Changes:
. Ctrl-F2 now functions as CONTROL-RESET (same as Ctrl-Break)

1.16.0 - 1 Feb 2009 (beta)
---------------------------
Changes:
. Support for Apple // Game Server via TCP (port 1977) : beta
. For GPL reasons, switched the following modules:
  - AY8910 (from MAME  to FUSE) : beta Mockingboard/Phasor
  - MC6821 (from MAME  to VICE) : beta Mouse card

1.15.0.3 - 31 Aug 2008 (beta)
-----------------------------
Changes:
. Remembers the last disk images used for Drive 1 & 2
  - Is updated when you insert or remove a disk
. PrintScreen key now saves screen shots!
  - Saved in .bmp format in the last directory you opened a disk from.
  - The filename generated depends if a floppy disk is mounted:
      o no disk mounted: "AppleWin_ScreenShot_#.bmp"
      o use the last disk mounted: "{DiskFilename}_#.bmp"
  - default saves to 560x384 resolution.
  - Shift+PrintScreen will save a 280x192 .bmp
    Note: In case you are wondering about the non-standard resolution 560x384
      o Width is 560 in order to save double hi-res graphics, and
      o Height is 384 because we double the vertical scan lines to
        preserve the original aspect ratio using a 560 width.
  - To enable the dialog box display of the last file saved to,
    use the command line option: -printscreen
. Added new video mode: "Monochrome - Authentic"
  - Every odd scanline is black to replicate that authentic look of the Apple Green monitors
  - Similar to ApplePC's "Green monochrome" mode
. Debugger 2.6.0.6
  - Added new command '@' to re-display results of search, colorized.
    Example:
	  S F000:FFFF C050
	  @ // re-display search results
  - Renamed GO to G to not conflict with new commands GR, GR1, GR2
  - Added 18 new view output commands from inside the debugger!
      TEXT, TEXT1, TEXT2
	  TEXT80, TEXT81, TEXT82
	  GR, GR1, GR2
	  DGR, DGR1, DGR2
	  HGR, HGR1, HGR2
	  DHGR, DHGR1, DHGR2
    Example:
      F7 // enter debugger
      HELP VIEW // view help summary
      HGR // view current Hi-Res Screen. press a key to return to the normal debugger view
  - Added aliases:
      TEXT40, TEXT41, TEXT42
  - Fixed command 'G' to not send the Return of the command into the Apple Keyboard
  - Fixed command '?' to list commands sorted and colorized
  - Fixed command 'HELP' to not display extra blank-line
  
Fixes:

1.14.2.0 - 23 Jun 2008
----------------------
Changes:
. Support for Bulgarian clones: Pravets 82 & 8A
. Mouse can be configured to show/hide crosshairs; and can be restricted (or not) to AppleWin's window
. Added 'Send to CiderPress' function via the context menu of the drive buttons
. Added support for "The Freeze's" F8 ROM (Apple][ & Apple][+ only)

1.14.1.3
--------
Beta builds for specific testers

1.14.1.2 PR - 20 Apr 2008
----------------------------
. Support for Pravets 82. Caps Lock serves as Lat/Cyr lock. The charset still needs a little fix (all characters have to be one row down).
. Some partial support for Pravets 8A. Caps Lock serves as Lat/Cyr lock, and F10 serves as Caps Lock.
In Pravets 8A mode the former behaviour of the F10 key is preserved as Ctrl+F10 (see Help/Keyboard for details).
Extended Basic and Miniassembler work, but there are still problems with the 8 bit charset (Парис [Parris] does not switch to latin characters).
Some keys have to be remapped, because currently they are not available (i.e. Э). There is still the problem that there is not enough space for this key on the keyboard.
. Added Send to CiderPress function via the popup menu of the drive buttons.

1.14.1.2 - 2 Dec 2007 (beta)
----------------------------
. Change: Removed crosshairs in mouse-mode

. Added -f8rom <custom.rom> cmd line switch to allow loading a custom 2K Rom at $F800
. Added support for "The Freeze's" F8 ROM (Apple][ & Apple][+ only)
  - It's a non-autostart ROM (was used for cracking). Use 'C600G' command to boot floppy
  - It added extended output in the Monitor's 'L' command.
. Fix: Use mouse position delta (fixes GEOS)

1.14.1.1 - 13 Aug 2007 (beta)
-----------------------------
. Fix: Infiltrator (floating bus was not being returned for all unmapped I/O)
. Fix: Mouse card is now reset on a system reset (reboot from Fantavision to Dazzle Draw : 'no mouse installed' problem)
. Fix: CLEARMOUSE cmd was resetting the clamp value (Fantavision problem)

1.14.1.0 - 09 Aug 2007 (beta)
-----------------------------
. Fix: Mouse support in Contiki v1.3


1.14.0 - 08 Aug 2007 (beta)
---------------------------
Fixes:
. Super Serial Card: PR#2 & IN#2 now working

Changes:
. Attempt to use drive1's image name as the name for the .aws file
. Added Apple//e (original 6502 version with "Venetian Blinds" self-test)
. Turbo mode via Scroll Lock (temporary or toggle mode) - selectable via UI

Beta:

* Added: 65C02 CMOS undefined opcode support (for //e)
* Added: Simple parallel printer support in slot-1
  . Creates (or overwrites) a file called "Printer.txt" in AppleWin.exe's folder
  . Eg. PR#1, then LIST, then PR#0
  . The file will auto-close 10 seconds after the last printed output
* Fix: [Bug #7238] FLASH support in 80-column mode
* Fix: [Bug #8300] 80-col text in Silvern Castle got corrupted

* Docs updated (although debugger docs still partially out of date)
* Debugger:
  + Now uses Apple font
  + Can configure entry to debugger via specific opcode or illegal(6502)/undefined(65C02) opcode - use BRKOP cmd

1.12.9.1 - 10 Mar 2006
----------------------
* Right-Click on drive icon for disk popup menu. Options are:
        o Eject disk
        o Read only (write protection on.)
        o Read / Write (write protection off.)
        Note: If a file is read-only, the Read only option will be checked.
* Fixed invalid F7 opcode addressing mode, so Lock N' Chase is now playable.
* Video Blanking Timing now has preliminary support.
    i.e. Drol now longer stalls at the cutscene.
    Note: The VBL is not exact timing (yet), so some games like Karateka might exhibit a little choppiness.
* Debugger 2.5.0.16
        o New Command: #G, same as Apple "Monitor" go command, where # is an hex address.
            i.e. C600G
        o New Command: #L, same as Apple "Monitor" list command, where # is an hex address.
            i.e. 300L
        o New Command: //
        Starts a line comment anywhere in the line.
        o New Command: RUN "filename", to run a debugger script
        o New Command: ECHO ...
        Text may be quoted: ECHO "...text..."
        Echo the current line, since scripts don't echo their commands.
        o New Command: SH address ## [? ?? ##]
            You can now search memory!
            i.e.
            SH 800,8000 AD ? C0 // search for one byte gap, AD xx C0
            SH 800,8000 C030 // search for two bytes: 30 C0
        o Mini-Assembler preview:
        Note: None of the indexed/indirect modes are working (yet), expressions are not evaluated.
            usage: A address
            usage: A
            The assembler prompt is the '!' -- for your mini-assembler fans ;-)
            The format is: label mnemonic []
            To exit the assembler, press Enter without any input.
            The spacebar to execute the next instruction is disabled while in assembler mode. You must press space, if you don't wish to define a label.
        o Fixed Console sometimes not drawing.
        o Fixed UI bug: Memory View text over-writing buttons.
        o Changed BPX to now defaults to setting breakpoint at cursor.
        o Changed BP to now default to setting breakpoint at Program Counter (PC)
        o Added new color scheme: BW. (This used to be an alias for MONO before.)

- Fixed DELREG.INF
- Reset now switches Alternate char set off
- PC's delete key maps to Apple's DEL key
- Fixed characters: '6', '|', '_'


1.12.3 - 04 Jan 2004
--------------------
Changes:
- Added Thomas Stahl's TV emulation mode: "Color (TV emulation)".
  Tested with Karateka, Mindshadow.
	"As you probably know, many of the higher sophisticated Apple ][+
	games made use of the blurr-effekt that color TV-monitors had on
	patterns consisting of horizontal color stripes. Using this effect it
	was possible to produce *solid* mix colors like grey, purple, pink,
	yellow and aquamarine even in the 2+ *hi-res mode*."
- Included Thomas Stahl's adjusted hires colors:
	He "adjusted the hires colors for a more realistic look -
	at least in comparison with an Apple PAL-System."
- Changed wording in Config dialog: from "Color (optimized)" to "Color (text optimized)".
- Fixed Config dialog (speed settings were misplaced in 1.12.2).
- Fixed Joystick 2 for Mario Bros: Now when in dual-joystick mode, 2nd joystick
  button controls both switches #1 & #2 as one.
- Fixed Mockingboard IRQ frequency problem (Ultima 4 & 5 tunes now play at correct rate).
- Added Applewin.chm to release zip. (NB. This hasn't changed from 1.10.4)


1.12.2 - 05 Jul 2003
--------------------
Changes:
- Added support for 2nd joystick.
  If the 2nd Apple joystick is enabled, then the buttons are re-configured:
  - Joystick 1 controls only button #0 (ie. not button #1 too)
  - Joystick 2 controls only button #1 (ie. not button #2)
  This is so that player 1 can't affect player 2's controls.
  So there is no way to control button #2 via a joystick. I don't think this will be a problem.
  Of course Left Alt, Right Alt and Shift still activate the 3 buttons.
  NB. Disable 2nd joystick if playing a 1 player game that requires the use of buttons 0 and 1.
  Tested with Archon I, Archon II and One-on-one.


1.12.1 - 24 Nov 2002
--------------------
Changes:
- Changed tone waveform from orthodox square-wave to a more logarithm shape,
  based on real MB waveform analysis. This is by no means perfect, but in my
  opinion gives the tones more musical quality.
- Added MB enable/disable switch to Configuration dialog.
- Added simple logging support. If AppleWin is started from the command line
  (DOS box) with the '-l' switch, then a text log file, AppleWin.log, will be
  generated. This can hopefully be used to diagnose problems some users are having.


1.12.00 - 17 Nov 2002
---------------------
- Initial release.
- Supports 2 Mockingboard cards in slots 4 & 5
- 12 voices and noise supported using DirectX 8.1.
- Tested on Win98, 2000 and XP platforms.
