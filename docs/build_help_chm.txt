=== Updating CHM ===

    cd help
    "C:\Program Files (x86)\HTML Help Workshop\hhc" AppleWin.hhp

To view:

    start AppleWin.chm

The batch file "update.bat" will both compile and view the CHM.


=== Installing Microsoft Help Workshop ===

The official site is here...

* https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/desktop/htmlhelp/microsoft-html-help-downloads

... but in typical MS fashion it is outdated -- it has two broken links since the Help Workshop is not on "Microsoft Download Center."

i.e.

* https://download.microsoft.com/download/0/A/9/0A939EF6-E31C-430F-A3DF-DFAE7960D564/htmlhelp.exe
* https://download.microsoft.com/download/0/a/9/0a939ef6-e31c-430f-a3df-dfae7960d564/htmlhelpj.exe

This community question ...

* https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/265752/htmlhelp-workshop-download-for-chm-compiler-instal.html

... says to use Wayback Machine.

Installing it is straight-forward but you'll get a misleading pop-up dialog near the end:

    "This computer has a newer version of HTML Help."

This refers to the help VIEWER (which is already installed) and NOT the help COMPILER which was just installed.
