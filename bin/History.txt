---------------------
. [Change #631] Improvements for the RGB AppleColor card:
	- Relax the video-mode precondition to just ignore if VF_MIXED (previously required HIRES on) for Apple II Desktop.
	- Changing from DHGR B&W mode to HGR remains in B&W (color burst is off).

	- This reverts the default behaviour introduced from 1.27.6 (#558).
	- Use -altgr-sends-wmchar to allow AltGr+<key> to work correctly together.
	- NB. The reason for the revert was that it was preventing international keyboards from typing certain characters.
. [Change #616] Vertical blending now uses 560-pixel granularity for half-dot shift support (consistent with all other video modes).


1.28.2.0 - 24 Feb 2019

	- This is equivalent to emulating RGB video, ie. a video mode with sharp text and pixels.
	- NB. Unlike AppleWin 1.25, this is now cycle-accurate, so demos that synchronise with the video scanner will work correctly.
. [Change #603] Removed support for v1 save-state files.
	- Any v1 save-state files should be loaded into AppleWin 1.27, and then re-saved to a v2 save-state file.
. [Change #597] Removed the functionality for CTRL+F10 to reveal the mouse cursor.
. [Change #585] Added a 'Swap' HDD button to the Configuration->Disk property sheet.

		- Use to toggle between European or US video ROM.
. [Change #583] Added new switch: '-no-hook-alt':
	- Used to prevent left/right ALT from emulating Open/Solid Apple keys.

Changes:
. Alpha NTSC support


1.25.0.4 - 23 Apr 2015
----------------------
Fixes:
. [Bug #276] -d1 command line argument caused AppleWin to crash.


1.25.0.3 - 8 Sep 2014
---------------------
Note: This is the last planned version to support Win98/ME.
. The next release of AppleWin will be built with VS2008 Express, so will only work under Windows 2000 and later.

Changes:
. Changed the AppleWin project host from BerliOS to GitHub.
. [Feature #221] Restored F6 original behavior that was changed in v1.22.0.
     F6 Toggle full-screen / windowed mode.
     Ctrl-F6 Toggle windowed 1x/2x zoom.
. Ctrl-PrintScreen will copy the text screen (auto detect 40/80 columns) to the clipboard.
. [Feature #198] Alt-Enter toggles full screen.
. [Feature #199] Added a configuration option "Confirm reboot" to skip the F2 reboot confirmation.
. [Feature #201] Added display of current Track/Sector for the floppy drives.
  - In 2x window mode the status is displayed below the drive LEDs.
  - In full screen mode the status is displayed above the drive LEDS. The track/sector
    is shown only for the last drive accessed.
  Note: DOS3.3 Track/Sector status should be accurate.
        ProDOS support is preliminary -- the track/sector may show zero after an operation.
. Memory initialization defaults to a pattern of FF FF 00 00 (memclear 2).
. Added command line switch to specify the type of memory initialization pattern.
    -memclear #
  Where # ranges from 0 to 7.
  i.e.
     -memclear 0   Initialize memory to zero
     -memclear 1   Initialize memory to random values
     -memclear 2   Initialize memory to 4 byte pattern: FF FF 00 00 (default, same as v1.24.0)
     -memclear 3   Initialize memory to even pages FF, odd pages 00
     -memclear 4   Initialize memory to first half page 00, last half page FF
     -memclear 5   Initialize memory to first half page FF, last half page 00
     -memclear 6   Initialize memory to byte offset of that page
                   (current memory address low byte)
                   i.e. 00:00 01 02 03 ... for page $20
     -memclear 7   Initialize memory to page address
                   (current memory address high byte)
                   i.e. 00:20 20 20 20 ... for page $20
  NOTE: -memclear 6 can cause a few programs to NOT function correctly
        due to hidden bugs of programmers not correctly initializing memory or
        using uninitialized memory.  RNDL/RHND and $620B are initialized to
        allow Pooyan, and the Beautiful Boot game launcher to run, along with
        $BFFD..BFFF to allow Copy ][ v5 to boot correctly.
. Debugger (v2.8.0.0):
  - Added: TSAVE "filename" to save the text screen to a file.
    It will auto-detect the current video mode: 40/80 columns.
    Default filename for 40 columns is: AppleWin_Text40.txt
    Default filename for 80 columns is: AppleWin_Text80.txt
 - Changed: DS to ASC because DS is used as a common "Define Space" assembler directive
 - Added: Experimental "ASC" command to mark up data as Apple text.
    using Castle Wolfenstien.DSK
    BLOAD ^VOCAB
    ASC name1 17DA:17F5
 - Fixed: DB address now auto-defines the symbol D_#### if no symbol is given.
 - Fixed: DW address now auto-defines the symbol W_#### if no symbol is given.
 - Fixed: ASB address now auto-defines the symbol T_#### if no symbol is given.
 - Added: Help for DB and DW.

Fixes:
. [Bug #206] Pooyan would freeze due to RNDL/RNDH not initialized to non-zero values on
  a cold boot.
. [Bug #177] Full-screen under Windows8/8.1 would show a corrupt, pastel color palette.
. Debugger:
  - Hang with Memory Fill when memory ends at FFFF, i.e. F D000:FFFF 0
  - Hang with Memory Move when memory ends at FFFF, i.e. 2000<FFFE.FFFFM

	. If no filename specified, will use last BLOAD or BSAVE filename.
	Extended debugger BSAVE with bank support:
	. BSAVE [file],[bank:]address,length
	. BSAVE [file],[bank:]address:end
	. If no filename specified, defaults to: '####.####.[bank##].bin'
		(where the form is <address>.<length>.bin)

Fixes:
. Fixed save-state bug for when 4K BANK1 is dirty (previously it would save the stale data instead).
. [Bug #18723,#19070] Mouse movement for CopyII+9.1 and ProTERM3.1.

  - Saved in .bmp format in the last directory you opened a disk from.
  - The filename generated depends if a floppy disk is mounted:
      o no disk mounted: "AppleWin_ScreenShot_#.bmp"
      o use the last disk mounted: "{DiskFilename}_#.bmp"
  - default saves to 560x384 resolution.
  - Shift+PrintScreen will save a 280x192 .bmp
    Note: In case you are wondering about the non-standard resolution 560x384
      o Width is 560 in order to save double hi-res graphics, and
      o Height is 384 because we double the vertical scan lines to
        preserve the original aspect ratio using a 560 width.
  - To enable the dialog box display of the last file saved to,
    use the command line option: -printscreen
. Added new video mode: "Monochrome - Authentic"
  - Every odd scanline is black to replicate that authentic look of the Apple Green monitors
  - Similar to ApplePC's "Green monochrome" mode
. Debugger 2.6.0.6
  - Added new command '@' to re-display results of search, colorized.

	  TEXT80, TEXT81, TEXT82
	  GR, GR1, GR2
	  DGR, DGR1, DGR2
	  HGR, HGR1, HGR2
	  DHGR, DHGR1, DHGR2

  - Added aliases:
      TEXT40, TEXT41, TEXT42
  - Fixed command 'G' to not send the Return of the command into the Apple Keyboard

1.14.1.3
--------
Beta builds for specific testers

1.14.1.2 PR - 20 Apr 2008
----------------------------
. Support for Pravets 82. Caps Lock serves as Lat/Cyr lock. The charset still needs a little fix (all characters have to be one row down).
. Some partial support for Pravets 8A. Caps Lock serves as Lat/Cyr lock, and F10 serves as Caps Lock.
In Pravets 8A mode the former behaviour of the F10 key is preserved as Ctrl+F10 (see Help/Keyboard for details).
Extended Basic and Miniassembler work, but there are still problems with the 8 bit charset (Ïàðèñ [Parris] does not switch to latin characters).
Some keys have to be remapped, because currently they are not available (i.e. Ý). There is still the problem that there is not enough space for this key on the keyboard.
. Added Send to CiderPress function via the popup menu of the drive buttons.

  - It added extended output in the Monitor's 'L' command.
. Fix: Use mouse position delta (fixes GEOS)

1.14.1.1 - 13 Aug 2007 (beta)

--------------------
* New: Uthernet card support
  . Allows internet access when used with the Contiki OS
  . See: http://applewin.berlios.de/Uthernet.txt
* New: Floating bus support
  . Fixes the hang at Drol's cut-scene
  . Bob Bishop's Money Munchers is a little bit closer to working
* Change: Added support for SSC receive IRQ (eg. Z-Link)
* Fix: Checkerboard cursor back for //e mode
* Fix: [Bug #6778] enable harddisk not working in 1.12.9.1
* Fix: [Bug #6790] Right click menu stops working on drives
* Fix: [Bug #7231] AppleWin installed in path with spaces


1.12.9.1 - 10 Mar 2006
----------------------
* Right-Click on drive icon for disk popup menu. Options are:
        o Eject disk
        o Read only (write protection on.)
        o Read / Write (write protection off.)
        Note: If a file is read-only, the Read only option will be checked.
* Fixed invalid F7 opcode addressing mode, so Lock N' Chase is now playable.
* Video Blanking Timing now has preliminary support.
    i.e. Drol now longer stalls at the cutscene.
    Note: The VBL is not exact timing (yet), so some games like Karateka might exhibit a little choppiness.
* Debugger 2.5.0.16
        o New Command: #G, same as Apple "Monitor" go command, where # is an hex address.
            i.e. C600G
        o New Command: #L, same as Apple "Monitor" list command, where # is an hex address.
            i.e. 300L
        o New Command: //
        Starts a line comment anywhere in the line.
        o New Command: RUN "filename", to run a debugger script
        o New Command: ECHO ...
        Text may be quoted: ECHO "...text..."
        Echo the current line, since scripts don't echo their commands.
        o New Command: SH address ## [? ?? ##]
            You can now search memory!
            i.e.
            SH 800,8000 AD ? C0 // search for one byte gap, AD xx C0
            SH 800,8000 C030 // search for two bytes: 30 C0
        o Mini-Assembler preview:
        Note: None of the indexed/indirect modes are working (yet), expressions are not evaluated.
            usage: A address
            usage: A
            The assembler prompt is the '!' -- for your mini-assembler fans ;-)
            The format is: label mnemonic []
            To exit the assembler, press Enter without any input.
            The spacebar to execute the next instruction is disabled while in assembler mode. You must press space, if you don't wish to define a label.
        o Fixed Console sometimes not drawing.
        o Fixed UI bug: Memory View text over-writing buttons.
        o Changed BPX to now defaults to setting breakpoint at cursor.
        o Changed BP to now default to setting breakpoint at Program Counter (PC)
        o Added new color scheme: BW. (This used to be an alias for MONO before.)

1.12.3 - 04 Jan 2004
--------------------
Changes:
- Added Thomas Stahl's TV emulation mode: "Color (TV emulation)".
  Tested with Karateka, Mindshadow.
	"As you probably know, many of the higher sophisticated Apple ][+
	games made use of the blurr-effekt that color TV-monitors had on
	patterns consisting of horizontal color stripes. Using this effect it
	was possible to produce *solid* mix colors like grey, purple, pink,
	yellow and aquamarine even in the 2+ *hi-res mode*."
- Included Thomas Stahl's adjusted hires colors:
	He "adjusted the hires colors for a more realistic look -
	at least in comparison with an Apple PAL-System."
- Changed wording in Config dialog: from "Color (optimized)" to "Color (text optimized)".
- Fixed Config dialog (speed settings were misplaced in 1.12.2).
- Fixed Joystick 2 for Mario Bros: Now when in dual-joystick mode, 2nd joystick
  button controls both switches #1 & #2 as one.
- Fixed Mockingboard IRQ frequency problem (Ultima 4 & 5 tunes now play at correct rate).
- Added Applewin.chm to release zip. (NB. This hasn't changed from 1.10.4)


1.12.2 - 05 Jul 2003
--------------------
Changes:
- Added support for 2nd joystick.
  If the 2nd Apple joystick is enabled, then the buttons are re-configured:
  - Joystick 1 controls only button #0 (ie. not button #1 too)
  - Joystick 2 controls only button #1 (ie. not button #2)
  This is so that player 1 can't affect player 2's controls.
  So there is no way to control button #2 via a joystick. I don't think this will be a problem.
  Of course Left Alt, Right Alt and Shift still activate the 3 buttons.
  NB. Disable 2nd joystick if playing a 1 player game that requires the use of buttons 0 and 1.
  Tested with Archon I, Archon II and One-on-one.


1.12.1 - 24 Nov 2002
--------------------
Changes:
- Changed tone waveform from orthodox square-wave to a more logarithm shape,
  based on real MB waveform analysis. This is by no means perfect, but in my
  opinion gives the tones more musical quality.
- Added MB enable/disable switch to Configuration dialog.
- Added simple logging support. If AppleWin is started from the command line
  (DOS box) with the '-l' switch, then a text log file, AppleWin.log, will be
  generated. This can hopefully be used to diagnose problems some users are having.


1.12.00 - 17 Nov 2002
---------------------
- Initial release.
- Supports 2 Mockingboard cards in slots 4 & 5
- 12 voices and noise supported using DirectX 8.1.
- Tested on Win98, 2000 and XP platforms.
