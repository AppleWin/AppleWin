AppleWin 1.12 history
=====================

This version of AppleWin is based directly on Oliver Schmidt's 1.10.4 source.
In an effort to distinguish any subsequent releases I make from the other
variants of AppleWin, my release numbering system shall be 1.12.xx.

Restrictions/bugs:
- SSI263 emulation is very basic: there is no attempt to emulate rate, inflection or filters.
- Win98: 'Alt Gr' (Right-Alt) emits a Control key-press before the Right-Alt, so key combinations
  involving Closed-Apple (Right-Alt) will probably fail. Use Keypad's 'Del' instead.
- During Mockingboard playback, Speaker emulation isn't precise
- Speech emu is broken under WinXP (and Win98 too?)

1.12.3 - 04 Jan 2004
--------------------
Changes:
- Added Thomas Stahl's TV emulation mode: "Color (TV emulation)".
  Tested with Karateka, Mindshadow.
	"As you probably know, many of the higher sophisticated Apple ][+
	games made use of the blurr-effekt that color TV-monitors had on
	patterns consisting of horizontal color stripes. Using this effect it
	was possible to produce *solid* mix colors like grey, purple, pink,
	yellow and aquamarine even in the 2+ *hi-res mode*."
- Included Thomas Stahl's adjusted hires colors:
	He "adjusted the hires colors for a more realistic look -
	at least in comparison with an Apple PAL-System."
- Changed wording in Config dialog: from "Color (optimized)" to "Color (text optimized)".
- Fixed Config dialog (speed settings were misplaced in 1.12.2).
- Fixed Joystick 2 for Mario Bros: Now when in dual-joystick mode, 2nd joystick
  button controls both switches #1 & #2 as one.
- Fixed Mockingboard IRQ frequency problem (Ultima 4 & 5 tunes now play at correct rate).
- Added Applewin.chm to release zip. (NB. This hasn't changed from 1.10.4)


1.12.2 - 05 Jul 2003
--------------------
Changes:
- Added support for 2nd joystick.
  If the 2nd Apple joystick is enabled, then the buttons are re-configured:
  - Joystick 1 controls only button #0 (ie. not button #1 too)
  - Joystick 2 controls only button #1 (ie. not button #2)
  This is so that player 1 can't affect player 2's controls.
  So there is no way to control button #2 via a joystick. I don't think this will be a problem.
  Of course Left Alt, Right Alt and Shift still activate the 3 buttons.
  NB. Disable 2nd joystick if playing a 1 player game that requires the use of buttons 0 and 1.
  Tested with Archon I, Archon II and One-on-one.


1.12.1 - 24 Nov 2002
--------------------
Changes:
- Changed tone waveform from orthodox square-wave to a more logarithm shape,
  based on real MB waveform analysis. This is by no means perfect, but in my
  opinion gives the tones more musical quality.
- Added MB enable/disable switch to Configuration dialog.
- Added simple logging support. If AppleWin is started from the command line
  (DOS box) with the '-l' switch, then a text log file, AppleWin.log, will be
  generated. This can hopefully be used to diagnose problems some users are having.


1.12.00 - 17 Nov 2002
---------------------
- Initial release.
- Supports 2 Mockingboard cards in slots 4 & 5
- 12 voices and noise supported using DirectX 8.1.
- Tested on Win98, 2000 and XP platforms.
