AppleWin history
================

This version of AppleWin is based directly on Oliver Schmidt's 1.10.4 source.
The release numbering used to be restricted to 1.12.x, but we have now decided
to lift this restriction.

Restrictions/bugs:
- SSI263 emulation is very basic: there is no attempt to emulate rate, inflection or filters.
- During Mockingboard playback, Speaker emulation isn't precise


1.13.2 - 26 Mar 2007
--------------------
* Apple ][ (non-autostart monitor)
* 6502 NMOS illegal opcode support (for ][ & ][+)
* 65C02 CMOS undefined opcode support (for //e)
* Can configure entry to debugger via specific opcode or illegal(6502)/undefined(65C02) opcode - use BRKOP cmd
  - So you can run Apple at full-speed until it hits your breakpoint (eg. BRK)
* Fix: [Bug #7238] FLASH support in 80-column mode
* Fix: [Bug #8300] 80-col text in Silvern Castle got corrupted
* Fix for MB/Phasor for short phonemes - bug in DirectSound in WinXP (see KB327698)
* Docs updated
* Debugger:
  + Now uses Apple font
  + Mouse support: button & wheel
  + BLOAD/BSAVE
  + Search command: S/SH
  + New DISASM command
  + BRKOP, BRK # to enter debugger
* Disk ][ track stepping fixed (Mabel's Mansion now works)
* Simple parallel printer support in slot-1
  . Creates (or overwrites) a file called "Printer.txt" in AppleWin.exe's folder
  . Eg. PR#1, then LIST, then PR#0
  . The file will auto-close 10 seconds after the last printed output


1.13.1 - 07 May 2006
--------------------
* Fix: [Bug #7375]  Crashes on Win98/ME


1.13.0 - 02 May 2006
--------------------
* New: Uthernet card support
  . Allows internet access when used with the Contiki OS
  . See: http://applewin.berlios.de/Uthernet.txt
* New: Floating bus support
  . Fixes the hang at Drol's cut-scene
  . Bob Bishop's Money Munchers is a little bit closer to working
* Change: Added support for SSC receive IRQ (eg. Z-Link)
* Fix: Checkerboard cursor back for //e mode
* Fix: [Bug #6778] enable harddisk not working in 1.12.9.1
* Fix: [Bug #6790] Right click menu stops working on drives
* Fix: [Bug #7231] AppleWin installed in path with spaces


1.12.9.1 - 10 Mar 2006
----------------------
* Right-Click on drive icon for disk popup menu. Options are:
        o Eject disk
        o Read only (write protection on.)
        o Read / Write (write protection off.)
        Note: If a file is read-only, the Read only option will be checked.
* Fixed invalid F7 opcode addressing mode, so Lock N' Chase is now playable.
* Video Blanking Timing now has preliminary support.
    i.e. Drol now longer stalls at the cutscene.
    Note: The VBL is not exact timing (yet), so some games like Karateka might exhibit a little choppiness.
* Debugger 2.5.0.16
        o New Command: #G, same as Apple "Monitor" go command, where # is an hex address.
            i.e. C600G
        o New Command: #L, same as Apple "Monitor" list command, where # is an hex address.
            i.e. 300L
        o New Command: //
        Starts a line comment anywhere in the line.
        o New Command: RUN "filename", to run a debugger script
        o New Command: ECHO ...
        Text may be quoted: ECHO "...text..."
        Echo the current line, since scripts don't echo their commands.
        o New Command: SH address ## [? ?? ##]
            You can now search memory!
            i.e.
            SH 800,8000 AD ? C0 // search for one byte gap, AD xx C0
            SH 800,8000 C030 // search for two bytes: 30 C0
        o Mini-Assembler preview:
        Note: None of the indexed/indirect modes are working (yet), expressions are not evaluated.
            usage: A address
            usage: A
            The assembler prompt is the '!' -- for your mini-assembler fans ;-)
            The format is: label mnemonic []
            To exit the assembler, press Enter without any input.
            The spacebar to execute the next instruction is disabled while in assembler mode. You must press space, if you don't wish to define a label.
        o Fixed Console sometimes not drawing.
        o Fixed UI bug: Memory View text over-writing buttons.
        o Changed BPX to now defaults to setting breakpoint at cursor.
        o Changed BP to now default to setting breakpoint at Program Counter (PC)
        o Added new color scheme: BW. (This used to be an alias for MONO before.)

1.12.3 - 04 Jan 2004
--------------------
Changes:
- Added Thomas Stahl's TV emulation mode: "Color (TV emulation)".
  Tested with Karateka, Mindshadow.
	"As you probably know, many of the higher sophisticated Apple ][+
	games made use of the blurr-effekt that color TV-monitors had on
	patterns consisting of horizontal color stripes. Using this effect it
	was possible to produce *solid* mix colors like grey, purple, pink,
	yellow and aquamarine even in the 2+ *hi-res mode*."
- Included Thomas Stahl's adjusted hires colors:
	He "adjusted the hires colors for a more realistic look -
	at least in comparison with an Apple PAL-System."
- Changed wording in Config dialog: from "Color (optimized)" to "Color (text optimized)".
- Fixed Config dialog (speed settings were misplaced in 1.12.2).
- Fixed Joystick 2 for Mario Bros: Now when in dual-joystick mode, 2nd joystick
  button controls both switches #1 & #2 as one.
- Fixed Mockingboard IRQ frequency problem (Ultima 4 & 5 tunes now play at correct rate).
- Added Applewin.chm to release zip. (NB. This hasn't changed from 1.10.4)


1.12.2 - 05 Jul 2003
--------------------
Changes:
- Added support for 2nd joystick.
  If the 2nd Apple joystick is enabled, then the buttons are re-configured:
  - Joystick 1 controls only button #0 (ie. not button #1 too)
  - Joystick 2 controls only button #1 (ie. not button #2)
  This is so that player 1 can't affect player 2's controls.
  So there is no way to control button #2 via a joystick. I don't think this will be a problem.
  Of course Left Alt, Right Alt and Shift still activate the 3 buttons.
  NB. Disable 2nd joystick if playing a 1 player game that requires the use of buttons 0 and 1.
  Tested with Archon I, Archon II and One-on-one.


1.12.1 - 24 Nov 2002
--------------------
Changes:
- Changed tone waveform from orthodox square-wave to a more logarithm shape,
  based on real MB waveform analysis. This is by no means perfect, but in my
  opinion gives the tones more musical quality.
- Added MB enable/disable switch to Configuration dialog.
- Added simple logging support. If AppleWin is started from the command line
  (DOS box) with the '-l' switch, then a text log file, AppleWin.log, will be
  generated. This can hopefully be used to diagnose problems some users are having.


1.12.00 - 17 Nov 2002
---------------------
- Initial release.
- Supports 2 Mockingboard cards in slots 4 & 5
- 12 voices and noise supported using DirectX 8.1.
- Tested on Win98, 2000 and XP platforms.
