To-do list
==========

This is a (non-exhaustive) list of stuff that I personally would like to get done:

. Consolidate the Spkr_SubmitWaveBuffer() & Spkr_SubmitWaveBuffer_FullSpeed() funcs.
This will make the code cleaner & simpler.

. Software mix Speaker & Mockingboard waves before submitting to sound-buffer.
This will:
a) fix the problem with speaker sound be rough when MB is active.
b) probably fix the problem with other processes having problems playing sound at the
same time as AppleWin. (Although I've not experienced this)
c) hopefully simplify things :)

. Ditch support for sound via the PC speaker.

. Run emulation (or message-pump?) in a seperate thread.
So that the sound is continuous when dragging the window or starting other applications, etc.

. Add proper Votrax support (using PinMAME samples & code).

. Fix SSI263 so that phonemes are overlapped (like Votrax).

. Support for zipped disk images (r/w) & harddisk images (read-only, but maybe write too?)

. Save-state supporting Phasor, harddisk & Ramworks III

. Floating-bus support (using Nick Westgate's code)
For Drol, Lock'n'Chase, TetrisII, etc

. Support for switching display modes mid-frame
