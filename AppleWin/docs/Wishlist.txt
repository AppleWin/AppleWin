Post 1.12.9.1:
- Could you add the possibility to create save state with the name of the disk image loaded
  For example, I am playing to Lode Runner (Lode Runner.dsk)
  Pressing F11 or another key would create an file named Lode Runner.aws
  Now, if I change the image disk (MoonPatrol.dsk), pressing Ctrl+F12 would load MoonPatrol.aws
  Like that, there is not risk to erase accidently or "unqiue" save state named SaveState.aws
