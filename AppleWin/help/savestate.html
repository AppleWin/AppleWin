<p style="font-weight: bold;">Overview:
</p>

<p>The complete<sub style="font-weight: bold;">1</sub>
Apple //e state can be saved to a
PC file at any time. This can be useful for continuity across AppleWin
sessions or to help with games that don't have a save option.</p>

<p>This is controlled by the AppleWin Configuration tab
labelled <em>Save State</em>.</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;">Details:</p>

<p>The entire Apple //e state is saved to a file (.aws). This
includes Disk][ (even during r/w operation) and Mockingboards.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">1</span>
Currently the harddisk state is not persisted
to the .aws file.</p>

<p>Note: Only the file names of the disk images are stored in
the .aws (not the full path). This allows you to move your disk image
around or distribute them. If AppleWin can't locate the disk image(s),
then it will prompt for the new location.</p>

<p>For the file format of the
.aws file, see the source file:
AW_Structs.h</p>

<p>From the <em>Save

This is the current save state file which is used for all save state
operations.</p>

Checking this means the Apple's state is automatically saved when you
quit AppleWin. Additionally the Apple's state is automatically restored
from this file when you re-start AppleWin.</p>
