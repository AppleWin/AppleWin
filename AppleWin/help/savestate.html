		<p style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Overview:
		</p>
		<p>The complete<sub style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">1</sub> Apple //e state can be saved 
			to a PC file at any time. This can be useful for continuity across AppleWin 
			sessions or to help with games that don't have a save option.</p>
		<p>This is controlled by the AppleWin Configuration tab labelled <em>Save State</em>.</p>
		<p style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Details:</p>
		<p>The entire Apple //e state is saved to a file (.aws). This includes Disk][ (even 
			during r/w operation) and Mockingboards.</p>
		<p><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">1</span>
			Currently the harddisk state is not persisted to the .aws file. Phasor and 
			Uthernet cards are not persisted either.</p>
		<p>Note: Only the file names of the disk images are stored in the .aws (not the 
			full path). This allows you to move your disk image around or distribute them. 
			If AppleWin can't locate the disk image(s), then it will prompt for the new 
			location.</p>
		<p>For the file format of the .aws file, see the source file: AW_Structs.h</p>
