		This describes the mode of emulation. &nbsp;You have the option of emulating 
		the predecessors of the Apple //e: the Apple ][ and Apple ][+. Besides running 
		with a different Apple system ROM, some differences are discussed below.<br>
		<ul>
			<li>
			Apple ][ : Non-autobooting, 64K machine, no lower-case, no 80-column, 6502 CPU
			<li>
			Apple ][+ : Autobooting version of the Apple ][
			<li>
			Apple //e : 128K machine, lower-case, 80-column, 6502 CPU</li>
			<li>
			Enhanced Apple //e : 128K machine, lower-case, 80-column, 65C02 CPU</li>
			<li>
			Clone (specific model selectable from Advanced page)</li>
		</ul>
		<strong>Video:</strong><br>
		AppleWin can display Apple video in a variety of modes. The display can also be 
		run in a standard window or full-screen. This option describes the type of 
		video emulation to be used for the emulator. Some differences might be 
		discussed below.<br>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Monochrome (custom) :</strong>&nbsp;This mode emulates a monochrome 
				monitor. You can choose your monochrome color from the <em>Monochrome Color</em>
			button described below.
			<LI>
				<STRONG>Monochrome (amber/green/white) :</STRONG>&nbsp;Monochrome with 
			specified color.
			<li>
				<strong>Color (standard) :</strong>&nbsp;This mode emulates a standard 
			color monitor.
			<li>
				<strong>Color (text optimized) :</strong>&nbsp;This mode does a bit of 
			image processing to make text more readable on the hires screen.
			<li>
				<strong>Color (TV emulation) :</strong>&nbsp;This mode emulates how colors 
				would bleed into one another on a TV. On the hires screen, alternating 
				horizontal lines of color are bled together to form new colors like grey, 
				purple, pink, yellow and aquamarine. This effect was used in commercial games 
				like Karateka and many hires adventures (eg. Mindshadow).
			</li>
                <li><strong>50% Scan line :</strong> Only draw alternate scanline (for better monitor
                    authenticity).</li>
		</ul>
		<P>
			<strong>Serial Port:<br>
			</strong>This option will remap the emulated Apple's serial port to your PC's 
			serial port (or TCP port 1977). The Apple Super Serial Card (SSC) is emulated in slot-2.<br>
            The TCP interface to the Apple SSC can be used by the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/a2gameserver">Apple // Game Server</a>.
            For details see the notes that comes with AGS:<br>
            <li>Boot the Apple II to AppleSoft (ie. power on and hit Ctrl-Reset) and type IN#2.
            </li>
            <li>From a Windows DOS box, start AGS with "localhost 1977 apple2e". This will boot the emulated Apple II from AGS.</li>
            <li>Nb. Only Enhanced Apple //e is working at the moment.
            <br>
			<STRONG>
				<BR>
				Ethernet Settings...:</STRONG>
			<br>
			This allows to choose which network interface card (NIC) you want to 
			use&nbsp;with the Uthernet card.<P><STRONG>Monochrome Color:</STRONG><br>
			This is the color to use when you choose a monochrome video mode.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Emulation Speed Control:</strong><br>
			This option let's you control the processor speed of the emulated system. You 
			may choose to use an authentic speed (matching the speed of the original 
			processor from the system) or you can underclock or overclock the emulated 
			processor speed from half-speed to as fast as your PC can emulate.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Benchmark Emulator:</strong><br>
			This will run a benchmark test that will show how fast your PC can emulate an 
			Apple //e system with this emulator. &nbsp;In order to run the benchmark, the 
			emulated machine must be reset and you will lose any unsaved work. You will be 
			prompted before you continue this action. The results given are:<br>

		<ul>
			<li>
			Pure Video FPS
			<li>
			Pure CPU MHz
			<li>
				Expected average video game performance (in FPS)</li>
