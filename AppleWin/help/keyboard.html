		<hr size="4">
		<p>The Apple //e keyboard was very similar to the PC keyboard, and most keys 
			correspond directly between the two keyboards. However, there were a few keys 
			on the Apple //e that are not on the PC; these are described below:</p>
		<p><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Reset</span>:<br>
			On the Apple //e, you could usually press Control+Reset to interrupt a running 
			program. With the Apple //e Emulator, you may emulate this key sequence with
			<span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Ctrl+Break</span>.
		</p>
		<p><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Open Apple:</span><br>
			The Open Apple key was first introduced in the Apple //e, and was later renamed 
			to the Apple key. It was similar to
			<span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Ctrl</span>
			and
			<span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Alt</span>
			on a PC, in that it was used in conjunction with other keys. This key is 
			emulated with the PC's left
			<span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Alt</span>
			key, which is in the same position as the Open Apple key on the original //e.
		</p>
		<p><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Solid Apple:</span><br>
			The Solid Apple key was introduced on the Apple //e and later renamed to the 
			Option key. This key is emulated with the PC's right
			<span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Alt</span>
			key, which is in the same position as the Solid Apple key on the original //e.
		</p>
		<p><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Numeric Keypad:</span><br>
			The numeric keypad, introduced on the Extended Keyboard //e, is emulated 
			through the PC's numeric keypad. To enable this feature, turn on
			<span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Num Lock </span>and make sure the joystick 
			emulation is configured to use something other than the keyboard.
		</p>
		<p><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Pause:</span><br>
			Pressing the PC's
			<span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Pause</span>
			key will pause emulation. Press
			<span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Pause</span>
			again to resume emulation.</p>
		<p><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Scroll Lock:</span><br>
			Holding down the PC's
			<span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Scroll
Lock</span>
			key temporarily sets the emulation to full speed (i.e. unthrottled).<br>
			NOTE:&nbsp; The status of the PC's
			<span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Scroll Lock</span>
			LED is meaningless.&nbsp; The emulator will only run full-speed while the
			<span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Scroll Lock</span>
			key is pressed down.</p>
		<P><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Shift+Insert:</SPAN><BR>
			Paste text from Windows' clipboard. Text gets fed a character at a time to the 
			Apple's keyboard hardware. The 'CR+LF' combination&nbsp;gets converted to CR.</P>
		<P>
			<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Function Keys
F1-F8:</span><br>
			These PC function keys correspond to buttons on the <a href="toolbar.html">toolbar</a>.</P>
		<p><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Function Key F9:</span><br>
			This PC function key will cycle through AppleWin's display modes:&nbsp; 
			monochrome (custom), color (normal), color (text optimized), color (TV 
			emulation), etc. This shortcut allows you to switch display modes without going 
			through the configuration dialog.</p>
		<p><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Function Key F10 (or
Ctrl+left mouse button):</span><br>
			This PC function key will stop emulating an Apple joystick with the PC's mouse.</p>
		<p><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Function Keys
F11-F12:</span><br>
			These PC function keys correspond to saving/loading a <a href="savestate.html">save-state</a>
			file.</p>
